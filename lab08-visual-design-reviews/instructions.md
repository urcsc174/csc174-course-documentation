# Lab 8: Visual Design Reviews

*Due: Friday, July 30, 2021*

**The goal** of this assignment is to create a markdown file in which you will review the other students' websites while focusing on the page design principles:

- C.R.A.P. principles
- Page layout patterns
- Typography

**The purpose** of this assignment is to develop your ability to critically assess visual designs.  In other words, instead of just writing about what you like or don't like, you need to describe what's wrong using technical terms.

*BTW - this lab assignment is a lot like Lab 2 where you did almost the same thing - reviewing other students' websites.  Except back then, you didn't have the tools to describe exactly what was wrong with the websites you were reviewing.  Now you **do** have that knowledge so you need to describe the improvement opportunities using the technical terms you learned from the three lectures on page design principles.*

## Step 1: Review Websites using Markdown 

*WARNING: this lab requires everyone to have a bit of a thick skin!  People will say things about your lovely design.  But keep in mind, it's all for the good!  This is how designers get better.*

*Also remember: as you write your reviews, keep in mind the real goal is to prove to the professor that you understand the principles of page design, and you can use those the technical terms correctly as you talk about a visual design.* 

- Create **a markdown file** to capture notes as you review other students' websites
  - You can name the markdown file whatever you want
  - Make sure to demonstrate your ability to use markdown appropriately in your document to prove you still know how to do it
  - Include typical college stuff at the top of the document: name, date, name of this assignment, etc., and then use appropriate headings and other typical document-y stuff to make it easy to read
- Go to [http://csc174.org/lab05/](http://csc174.org/lab05/) (the Lab 5 version of our websites) and review the TWO other students' websites
  - Note: we're using the Lab 5 version of your city websites because they contain the HTML forms and data tables which you need to review as well

### C.R.A.P Principles

For both of the other students' websites...


1. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **contrast** should have been used to highlight differences; <u>or</u> contrast removed to indicate similarity
2. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **repetition** should have been used to unify different parts that followed a pattern; <u>or</u> repetition should have been broken to indicate that the parts were disparate
3. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **alignment** should have been used to allow better flow (to increase comprehension) and unify the content; <u>or</u> elements should have been *mal-*aligned on purpose to purposefully slow-down or stagger the viewer to reduce flow (for purposes of making the viewer stop and think a bit)
4. Make a critique & suggestion for a place where **proximity** should have been used to show a connection (via closeness); <u>or</u> show difference (via distance)

## Page Layout

For both of the other students' websites...


1. Identify any use of a **Z-pattern** or **F-pattern**, or any other standard layout pattern and how it supports the Gutenberg Rule
   - Note: use terms such as "**Primary**", "**Strong Fallow**", "**Weak Fallow**", and "**Terminal**" as appropriate
2. Identify any area on any page where better use of the Gutenberg rule would improve its usability, and explain what elements should be where (in terms of the four quadrants) 

## Typography

For both of the other students' websites...


1. List all the fonts being used in the website and how they're being used (headings vs. regular text vs. any other applications)
   - Note: by *fonts* we mean "fonts", not typographic families, so every use of different size, weight, style, etc. is considered a different font.
2. Considering the apparent *mood* and *feel* of the content, describe why the fonts being used are appropriate OR why a different font and/or typographic familiy would be more appropriate.
