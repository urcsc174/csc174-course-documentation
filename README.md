Last topic: **Content Management Systems** (CMSs)

*As discussed, this topic is the culmination of everything we've covered in CSC 174 so, even though you won't be required (graded) to complete assignments for this topic, this would be a great topic to learn in support of your future career (even if you're not going into a web-related field ...because every employer these days assume Millennials and Gen-Zers like you know this stuff!)*

- [Content Management Systems (Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=77b3ed91-36e7-479b-be53-ad7f014dc0f6)) and ([PDF](13a-content-management-systems/content-management-systems.pdf))
  - This^ is a pre-recorded lecture from last year; there are still some references to lab assignments in the video that won't be required of you
- Non-required lab assignment (not turned-in): [Lab 11: WordPress (localhost only)](lab11-wordpress/instructions.md)
- Approved Tutorial: [How to create a blog in PHP and MySQL database (tutorial)](https://codewithawa.com/posts/how-to-create-a-blog-in-php-and-mysql-database)
  - To really learn a lot about Content Management Systems, you owe it to yourself to go through this tutorial^ and build one yourself.
  - You'll recognize EVERYTHING you're instructed to do because we covered all of it in CSC 174; this tutorial just brings it all together to create a fully functional CMS.
  - This build-your-own CMS has only a fraction of the functionality that a CMS like WordPress has, but based on what you do with this tutorial you'll begin to realize that even WordPress is not so mysterious!
