| Activity                                                     | Weight of the final grade                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Participation**<br>There are several required activities that students must perform for the benefit of the class which include participating in real-time discussions, online.  The total of all activities will count equally toward the total of 20% | **20%**<br>Each participation activity will be worth about 1.0% of the overall grade |
| **Lab Assignments**<br>There is lab work at the discretion of the instructor.  Each lab counts equally toward the total of 30%.  There will be around 10-15 lab assignments depending on the progress of the class during the semester. | **30%**<br>Each lab assignment will be worth about 2.0-3.0% of the overall grade |
| **Projects**<br>There are five projects during the semester, each of which will be completed by a team of students.  Everyone on the team initially gets the same grade, followed by a balancing process that rewards students who completed more of the work compared to their teammates, while penalizing students who were unable to complete their portion of the work. | **50%**<br/>Project 1: 10%<br>Project 2: 10%<br>Project 3: 10%<br>Project 4: 10%<br>Project 5: 10% |

## Labs and Project Assignments

After most lecture videos are published, **labs** and **projects** are made available via the Course Documentation website (the website you're looking at now) and can be completed independently on one's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).

NOTE: students are required to complete each lab or project within 24 hours of its due date. The instructor will make announcements in Slack to let everyone know when each assignment has been published, and when the due date is.

### Help

While working on any lab or project assignment and the student needs technical help:

1. STOP working - don't hack away on any one thing more than say, 15-20 minutes - and then **upload what you're working on** to the class web server
2. **Go to the #help channel** in Slack and create a new message to ask a specific question and then paste the URL of your work from the class web server
3. **Carry on** working on something else if possible while you wait for a reply

...The instructor (or maybe other students) will reply to your message and provide help as soon as possible, sometimes immediately, usually within 24 hours.

### Due Dates

For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown near the top of the lab instructions. To avoid a zero grade, they must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before their due date.  

Within **24 hours** of turning-in an assignment in Blackboard, the instructor will provide a grade ONE TIME only, and only if the assignment was submitted in Blackboard **on or before its due date**.  Assignments turned-in after the due date will get a zero, with some exceptions...

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be graded unless *a prior arrangement* has been made with the instructor to get an **extension by one or two days**.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the instructor. 

## Second chances

Re-grading assignments is at the instructor's discretion.  There is no obligation to do so.  However, **within one-day** of receiving a grade less than 100%, the student may fix the mistakes, re-upload their handiwork to the web server, and ask the instructor for a second chance.  The instructor *may* grant a second chance (by going into Blackboard and enabling it) so long as the mistakes made to the first submission appeared to be minor and the student has done their level best to correct them.

***Situations when students should <u>not</u> expect a second chance...***

- An assignment that appears to have been submitted on-time for the sole purpose of getting a second chance to submit the assignment again WILL NOT be re-graded.  I.e. the first submission must look like the student made an honest attempt to get the assignment right, else, if it looks terrible (as determined by the instructor), the grade will be left as-is and *not* re-graded.
- Late in the semester when the instructor and everyone is under the *crunch*, second chances will STOP.  When the we hit this point, the instructor will make an announcement in one of the lectures about this.
- Recommended: late in the semester, students should check with their instructor to see if they are able to re-grade their assignments.  (Don't assume it!  There is no obligation to do so.)

## Texts and Materials

Because of the dynamic nature of the web development industry, this course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the lectures so attendance is mandatory.  

Lectures are recorded and hosted in Panopto which provides the instructor a record of each students' access of each lecture, and the amount (%) of each lecture that they viewed.  The instructor will use the Panopto server records to assign a "participation" grade in Blackboard as needed.

NOTE: students are required to watch 100% of each lecture video within 24 hours of its publication on Panopto. 

### Personal Computer and Software

In addition to the hosted Web service, provided by the University, students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor
- FTP software
- "GitHub Desktop" software
- An updated, popular web browser
- An Internet connection
- A localhost "web stack" consisting of Apache, PHP, and MySQL software

For reference, in the lecture videos the instructor will be using

- a **Macbook** (usually) and a **Windows PC** (alternatively) 
- a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3))
- FTP software: **Cyberduck** (for Mac, [cyberduck.io](https://cyberduck.io/)) and **WinSCP** (for PC, [winscp.net/eng/download.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php))
- a localhost, provided by a software package called: **MAMP** (for Mac) or **MAMP for Windows** (for PC) ([mamp.info/en](https://www.mamp.info/en/)) 
- Demonstrations during the lectures will be done using **Google Chrome**.

## Academic Honesty

Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). More specifically for CSC 174, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices

In the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of inspiration.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)
